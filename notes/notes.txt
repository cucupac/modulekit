Where's the smart account?

Where's the validtor?

Where's the executor? 

Where's the Fallback handler?

Where's the hooks?



Session Key Notes:

Where is it coming from?

It's all coming from the UserOp.signature

-> session key digest
-> session key signature



Then, session data is actually a mapping for the specific smart account for:
-> the supplied digest
-> the specific account

_enabledSessionsData[sessionKeyDataDigest][smartAccount]

Presumably, it will hold some information about the session. Let's see.

It holds thr following in a the SessionData struct:
-> validUntil
-> validAfter
-> the session validate module (presumably address of smart contract)
-> sessionKeyData
    -> What's this? ANSWER: it's related to "scoped access", but in byte format
    struct ScopedAccess {
        address sessionKeySigner;
        address onlyToken;
        uint256 maxAmount;
    }


We now pass the signature, the session data, and traditional "to, calldata, value".
-> Did you sign off on it? Sig
-> What did you sign off on? SessionData




INSIGHT: Apparently, smart contracts can sign messages with ERC-1271???


FINALLY, I FOUND AN IMPLEMENTATION:

erc7579/src/MSABasic

-> It has all of the functions in the IMSA.

-> It also has a module manager and an execution helper
